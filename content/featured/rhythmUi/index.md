Rhythm is a powerful and accessible component library that I developed, aimed at providing reusable building blocks for creating React applications.

I developed a range of reusable, accessible, and optimized components for the Rhythm UI library, ensuring they are easy to integrate into any React application.

built a Tailwind CSS config generator that reduced the setup time by 50%, allowing developers to quickly customize styles and improve development speed.
