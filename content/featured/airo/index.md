The Airo project represents a groundbreaking advancement in the air conditioning sector, combining sophisticated technology with a user-friendly approach.

I led the frontend development of Airo’s web e-commerce application, integrating an AI-powered recommendation engine. This platform simplifies the AC buying process, provides intuitive control over units, and supports Airo’s commitment to sustainability and energy efficiency.
